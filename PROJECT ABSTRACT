ABSTRACT:
In modern military operations, rapid and accurate decision-making is critical for maintaining situational awareness and operational superiority. Traditional intelligence methods rely heavily on manual analysis of visual data, which is time-consuming and inadequate for the fast-paced nature of contemporary warfare. To address these limitations, this project presents an AI-Powered Tactical Intelligence System that leverages machine learning and deep learning to automate the classification of military assets such as tanks, helicopters, airplanes, and artillery units, enabling faster and more reliable battlefield assessments.
The system processes image data through a comprehensive pipeline involving resizing, normalization, and compression to ensure high-quality input for model training. It employs multiple classification models, including a Perceptron for baseline evaluation, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for non-linear pattern recognition, and a hybrid CNN-RNN (Convolutional Neural Network with LSTM) architecture designed to capture both spatial features and contextual dependencies in imagery. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure robust evaluation, and all models are trained and saved for reuse.
Performance is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity. Results show that the CNN-RNN model significantly outperforms traditional methods by effectively learning hierarchical visual features, leading to superior classification accuracy. A confusion matrix and classification report provide detailed insights into model behaviour, while heatmaps and performance graphs enhance interpretability.
A user-friendly Tkinter-based GUI enables seamless interaction through two distinct modes: ADMIN mode for dataset management, preprocessing, and model training; and USER mode for real-time image classification and visualization of training accuracy and loss curves. By integrating advanced AI techniques into a practical framework, the system demonstrates the potential of data-driven intelligence to enhance threat recognition and decision support in dynamic military environments.
